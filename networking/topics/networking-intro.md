# Networking Introduction

## OSI Model

- The OSI model is a conceptual framework for describing how two systems communicate over a network.
- It was meant to be a protocol suite to power networks but lost to TCP/IP.
- The OSI model description is a complex and exact way of saying networks have layers like cakes or onions.
- The OSI model breaks the responsibilities of the network into ```seven distinct layers```.
- The layers encapsulate information from the layer below it, these layers are Application, Presentation,
  Session, Transport, Network, Data Link and Physical.
- Each layer takes data from the previous layer and encapsulates it to make its Protocol Data Unit(PDU).
  The PDU is used to describe the data at each layer. PDUs are also part of TCP/IP.
