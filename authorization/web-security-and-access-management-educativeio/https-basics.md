# HTTPS Basics

- Symmetric encryption is much faster than asymmetric encryption and is used to encrypt a large amount of data.
- The keys used in symmetric encryption are not very large, as the max length is ```256 bits```.
- In asymmetric encryption, the sender and receiver use a separate key to encrypt and decrypt the message. 
  This is also known as **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**.
- The keys used in asymmetric encryption are fairly large and can be around ```2048 bits```.
